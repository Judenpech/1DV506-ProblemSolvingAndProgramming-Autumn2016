# 1DV506, Problem Solving and Programming, Autumn 2016
## [Assignment 1: Getting Started](http://homepage.lnu.se/staff/jlnmsi/java1/lab1eng.html)
Problems?

Do not hesitate to ask your teaching assistant at the practical meetings (or Jonas at the lectures) if you have any problems. You can also post a question in the assignment forum in Moodle.
### Exercises
#### Lecture 1 (Getting Started)
1. Install Java
Download and install Java SE JDK: www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads. Also, there are plenty of instruction videos available in YouTube. Just search for "Install Java X" where X is your operating system.
2. Install Eclipse
Download and install Eclipse IDE for Java Developers: http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/. Once again, there are plenty of instruction videos available in YouTube. Just search for "Install Eclipse X" where X is your operating system.
3. Setup Eclipse Workspace
Before you start programming, do the following.
- Create an Eclipse workspace (a folder) with the name java_courses on some location in your home directory.
- Create a Java project with the name 1DV506 inside the workspace.
- Create a package with the name YourLnuUserName_assign1 inside the project. For example, it might look something like wo222ab_assign1.
- Save all program files from the exercises in this assignment inside the package YourLnuUserName_assign1.
- In the future: create a new package (YourLnuUserName_assignX) for each assignment and a new project (with the course code as name) for each new course using Java.
4.Edit, compile and execute.
Create, compile and execute the following program inside your assignment 1 package:

>   /* The classical "Hello World!" program. */
>   public class Hello {
>      
>       public static void main(String[] args) { 	
>          System.out.println("Hello World!"); // Print
>       }	      
>   }

### Submission
*Only exercises 5-16 should be handed in. (Notice that the VG exercises 11 and 16 are not mandatory.) We are only interested in your .java files. Hence, zip the directory named YourLnuUserName_assign1 (inside directory named src) and submit it using the Moodle submission system.*
